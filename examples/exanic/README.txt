ExaNIC example programs
========================

This directory contains examples of programs which work with the
libexanic interface.


exanic-benchmarker.c
---------------------

This is an example of a benchmarking application written primarily for use with
ExaNIC HPT*. This tool is designed to allow you to quickly start working with
the ExaNIC HPT as well as a starting point for writing your own benchmarking
software. It operates in two modes, cable length estimation mode and system
measurement mode.

In cable length estimation mode, it can be used to estimate cable lengths where
the  propagation speeds are known. In system measurement mode, it can be used to
estimate the delay measured from TX to RX through some device, where both cable
lengths and propagation delays are known.

The application can also report raw measured values which can be used for
calibration and high precision benchmarking.

Examples and usage details can be found here:

*Although nothing prevents the application from being used with other devices
such as the X10/X40.



exanic-tx-preload.c
-------------------

 This is an example showing how to arbitrarily divide up the ExaNIC TX buffer,
 then load a number of frames into each slot and choose one to send later. The
 idea is to remove the overhead of transferring the packet to the card from the
 critical path.
